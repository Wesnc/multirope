# Multirope
*Bringing back the best features.*

## What is it?

Rolf removed the mooring ropes ability to lead more than 1 animal at a time. I created this mod with the point of bringing that item back.
For every mod I make, I strive to make every option highly configurable so there will be as little code changes as possible once released.

## Installation
Extract the contents of the rar file to your `/mods` folder.

## Crafting
You can create the item as you would any other rope using a ropetool and a wempfibre to create a 'leading rope'

## Config
You can find the config find in `/mods/multirope.properties`
````
#Is mod enabled?
mr.enabled = true

#Weight of the item in grams. NOTE: Only newly created items get the changed weight value, existing items stay as their old weights.
mr.weight = 1000

# Animal lead limit per 1 item (4 horses to 1 rope)
mr.leadlimit = 4
````
